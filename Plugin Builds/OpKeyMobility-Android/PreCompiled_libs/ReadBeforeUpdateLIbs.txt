We were facing issues in adding libraries .
mincap and minicap.so files were not adding while committing these libs .
Issue was resolved by adding each mincap and minicap.so file separately in each folder for each version.
So before committing see the size of file before commit and after commit .
Also dont delete all file just add new version libs by adding minicap and mincap.so after sdk version 31 onward 
These files are ignored by SVN.So you can remove minicap and minicap.so from svn ignore list in svn settings
