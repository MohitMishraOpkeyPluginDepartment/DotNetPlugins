----Change----

----Mandatory----

----Known Issues----
1. The java.exe under 'Windows Task Manager' against Selenium-RC server, remains unclosed exempting OpKey 5X CLEANUP POLICY i.e. 
	"the releasing of the acquired resource during the execution" to retain Opkey 4x behavior
	"acquire the successive run on the previously opened Selenium-RC server".
2. Though this plug-in version not aims to support any keyword interacting with browser and its related keyword. If someone uses
	then result will be NON-DETERMINISTIC, except below mentioned  
	"Browser and its preceding resources will violate OpKey 5X CLEANUP POLICY" and will remain opened after execution close.
